# Student Performance Prediction Using ML

This project uses machine learning models to predict students' exam scores based on various performance factors like study hours, attendance, parental involvement, and more.

## ðŸ§  Models Used
- Polynomial Regression (RÂ² score: 0.73)
- Decision Tree Regressor (RÂ² score: 0.46)

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Student Performance Factors]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors)) 
- Rows: 6,607  
- Features: 20 (e.g., Hours_Studied, Motivation_Level, Family_Income, etc.)

## ðŸ”§ Preprocessing
- Missing value handling
- Label Encoding for categorical variables
- Feature scaling using MinMaxScaler

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations
- Heatmap of feature correlation
- Histograms
- Scatter plots and count plots

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- RÂ² Score
